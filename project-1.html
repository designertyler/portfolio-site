              A multi-release initiative to modernize IBM Cloud’s service onboarding by moving off a legacy tool and
              into a modern, scalable experience. This work unified previously fragmented workflows, improved compliance
              alignment, and created a path to retire aging infrastructure. This saved the platform an estimated ~$45K
              per month while resolving long-standing friction points for both service onboarding teams and first-party
              approvers.

            <p>
              The service onboarding experience in IBM Cloud was split across two separate systems: a legacy tool used
              for first-party services (RMC) and a more modern tool used for third-party offerings (Partner Center).
            </p>

            <p>These systems act as control planes for bringing offerings into the IBM Cloud Catalog by centralizing
              onboarding tooling and requirements across billing, IAM, and governance and compliance, and enable
              publishing products to the marketplace.
              The separation between the two systems created fragmentation across workflows and limited the platform’s
              ability to scale and adopt new onboarding models.
            </p>


            <div class="user-quote">
              "...you may have heard of this acquisition. So, these guys want to onboard into the IBM cloud as a 1st
              party offering. <strong>They saw the service framework, and it has intimidated them to the point of
                rethinking whether this is
                a market for them or not.</strong>”

            <p>Key challenges included:</p>

                Catalog</li>
              <li>A legacy system operating on costly, aging infrastructure that was difficult to enhance</li>
              <li>Limited alignment with current compliance standards and onboarding workflows</li>
              <li>Minimal visibility for onboarders and approvers into approval status, required actions, or next steps
              </li>
              <li>Multiple stakeholder groups (BSS, IAM, security, catalog, ecosystem) each had their own requirements
                and vocabularies</li>
              <li>RMC and Partner Center needed to coexist for a period while services migrated in waves</li>
              <li>Engineering capacity was split across migration work and net-new features such as professional
                services onboarding</li>

            <p>
              The migration effort had to serve several audiences simultaneously: service owners (1st and 3rd party)
              onboarding new products, IBM approvers working through Service Framework pillars, ecosystem partners
              tracking their go-to-market progress, and end users consuming the services. Any change to onboarding flows
              could impact dozens of teams and millions in marketplace revenue, so we had to evolve the UX carefully
              with no disruptions.
            </p>

              Given the number of teams and systems involved, my role focused on driving clarity across the onboarding
              ecosystem—documenting current workflows, aligning requirements across pillars, and defining the UX
              patterns needed for a consolidated experience in one tool.
            </p>
            <p>This work took shape through the following activities:</p>

            <li>
              <strong>Mapping the as-is experience</strong><br>
              Partnered with another designer to document the RMC flows, Service Framework approval journeys, and
              Partner Center entry points. We used Mural to map end-to-end onboarding journeys for each pillar.

              points, required data, and “must-not-break” behaviors.

              </strong> The contact links for the service framework requirements and even the documentation were broken.
              It was a <strong>huge struggle to release anything</strong> because so much information was unmaintained.”

              <strong>Defining migration phases</strong><br>
              With PMs, we framed specific milestones to roll out each capability. Being a part of these conversations
              early in the planning process ensured the design team had the team we needed to do our best work. Each
              milestone achieved feature
              parity in Partner Center for onboarding platform services, then billable services, then professional
              services, followed by full RMC
              retirement.

              Evolved existing key UX patterns such as the onboarding checklist, product dashboard, and navigation to
              support both first-party and third-party services. We introduced maturity levels to better communicate
              where a service was in its lifecycle and improved the navigation to be scalable for future enhancements
