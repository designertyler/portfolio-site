              A multi-release initiative to modernize IBM Cloud’s service onboarding by moving off a legacy tool and
              into a modern, scalable experience. This work unified previously fragmented workflows, improved compliance
              alignment, and created a path to retire aging infrastructure. This saved the platform an estimated ~$45K
              per month while resolving long-standing friction points for both service onboarding teams and pillar
              approvers.

            <p>
              When I joined the onboarding modernization effort, IBM Cloud’s onboarding experience was effectively split
              in half. First-party teams used an aging legacy tool tied to costly infrastructure, and third-party teams
              used a more modern system that was missing key functionality for certain product types. For years, product
              teams navigated these two worlds with little visibility of
              system status, confusing requirements, and outdated docs.

            </div>

            <p>
              The fragmentation was noticeable. New services stalled during approval cycles and teams struggled to
              understand what needed to happen next. And for some service owners, the onboarding process itself was
              intimidating enough to reconsider whether they wanted to publish on IBM Cloud at all:
            </p>

            <div class="user-quote">
              “...you may have heard of this acquisition. So, these guys want to onboard into the IBM cloud as a 1st
              party offering. They saw the service framework, and it has <strong>intimidated them to the point of
                rethinking
                whether this is a market for them or not.</strong>”
              <span class="quote-source">— Product manager, user-testing participant</span>
            </div>

            <p>
              IBM Cloud needed one unified onboarding experience that was modern, scalable, and aligned with compliance
              requirements. Most importantly, this needed to happen without disrupting the hundreds of services already
              running through the legacy tool.

            <p>
              Before we could make changes, we had to understand the ecosystem end-to-end. I partnered with another
              designer and our researcher to map the current workflows across both systems, pillar by pillar (”Pillars”
              are distinct subject areas within the service framework and have their own requirements and approvers).
              What quickly surfaced was the sheer diversity of requirements: IAM, security, billing, catalog management,
              ecosystem teams, and Service Framework approvers all had different needs for onboarding.

              With the current state mapped, we defined the migration in phases by designing functionality in multiple
              releases. We started by enabling new platform services to onboard in the modern tool, then migrating
              billable services, then professional services, and eventually retiring the legacy tool entirely. I created
              a Gantt chart to give leadership visibility into the design team’s roadmap and to help sequence the
              engineering work.

            <h4>The checklist and lifecycle approvals</h4>
            <p>
              Users repeatedly told us they struggled to understand their approval status or maturity level. We
              redesigned the checklist to make system status, remaining work, and required documentation more clear.
            </p>

            <!-- Image: maturity levels / checklist -->

                <p class="fig-caption">
                  Showing progress for each maturity level helped users understand why some approvals were reset. The
                  previous design left users confused when an approval they already received was reset.

            <h4>Dashboard and navigation </h4>

              The new dashboard surfaced next steps, blockers, and important system data that was previously buried. The
              previous information architecture prevented the platform from scaling. We reorganized the experience
              to support new service types, workflows, and future enhancements.

              We iterated based on feedback, refined copy and state handling, and resolved edge cases as development
              progressed. Once the legacy tool was fully retired, the team was finally free to deliver net-new
              onboarding capabilities without rebuilding them twice.

              unlocking <strong>~$45K in monthly savings</strong> for the platform.

              Teams now have a shared experience for onboarding. The UI is aligned with the latest IBM design system and
              UI patterns. Pain points that had existed for years were finally resolved. And onboarding itself is
              faster, more visible, and far easier for new teams to adopt.
