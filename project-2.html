              This project (code-named Skybridge) was a cross-business initiative between IBM Cloud and IBM
              Software
              to define the end-to-end quote-to-cash experience for IBM SaaS subscriptions on IBM Cloud. The work aimed
              to preserve
              software profitability, support seller compensation, and achieve parity with how IBM SaaS is sold on other
              hyperscalers.
              My role focused on bringing clarity to this highly complex problem space through workflow mapping,
              cross-team alignment,
              and scenario-based UX flows that became reference artifacts for product, engineering, and leadership.

              sessions, and designed system-level flows that aligned multiple teams on a single private-offer model. I
              partnered closely with PMs, architects, and engineers to define requirements, expose dependencies, and
              create artifacts that could be used to guide both product strategy and implementation.

            <p>
              IBM Software’s strategy was to sell SaaS subscription entitlements for their products via IBM Cloud—not
              just as generic
              cloud spend, but as product-specific commitments that preserved margins and aligned with SaaS seller
              compensation. On paper, that sounded straightforward. In practice, IBM Cloud only supported a patchwork
              of ordering paths: pay-as-you-go plans, broad platform subscriptions/credits, or manual entitlements.
            </p>

            <p>
              IBM needed a quote-to-cash experience for IBM SaaS on IBM Cloud that was at least on
              par with how software was being sold on other hyperscalers. Pay-as-you-go models didn’t protect
              profitability or
              reflect the way SaaS commitments are negotiated. Generic credits hid product-level revenue. Manual
              entitlements didn’t scale and made even simple operations—like renewals or corrections—painful and risky.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we started mapping the current-state of the quote-to-cash flow, it became clear we needed to do more
              than “add
              a UI” on top.
            </p>

            <p>
              We had to define a unified subscription model that: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Preserved software profitability by supporting discrete SaaS commitments instead of relying solely on
                paygo models</li>
              <li>Incentivized larger customer commits through subscription and overage structures aligned with Software
                pricing</li>
              <li>Ensured product-level revenue attribution for SaaS subscriptions, not just generic platform spend</li>
              <li>Achieved parity with how IBM SaaS can be ordered on other hyperscalers</li>
              <li>Aligns the ordering model with SaaS seller compensation so that catalog orders would not harm seller
                incentives</li>

              With so many systems, users, and organizations involved, every UX decision carried downstream
              consequences. A label change in the UI might require a
              change in a contract template; a new field in a flow might require API behavior to be revisited. The
              design work had to operate at a system level, not just at the screen level.
            </p>

              A big part of my role was creating shared understanding by visualizing the system so everyone—whether from
              Software, Cloud, billing, or sales—could see how their work fit into the bigger picture. That work showed
              up in a few key ways:
            </p>

            <h4>Regular working sessions</h4>
            <p>
              One of the biggest wins of the project was securing daily standing calls with busy senior stakeholders.
              These weren’t status meetings—they were working sessions. We clarified requirements, surfaced hidden
              dependencies, and made design and product decisions in real time, instead of waiting weeks for alignment.
            </p>

            <h4>Parity with other hyperscalers</h4>
            <p>
              Sellers shared a surprising insight: selling IBM Software was often easier on other clouds than on IBM’s
              own. To understand why, we conducted a comparative analysis of private offer flows from leading
              hyperscalers and used those findings to set our baseline. If IBM Cloud couldn’t at least match those
              experiences, we would always be fighting uphill.
            </p>

              </div>
            </div>

            <h4>Understanding technical limitations</h4>
            <p>
              The UX we could deliver was tightly coupled to what the underlying systems exposed. We spent time mapping
              how information moved from quote, to offer, to subscription, to pricing plan—and what data the APIs made
              available at each step. That understanding was critical when deciding what the UI could responsibly
              display and when we needed to introduce new states or constraints.
            </p>

              </div>
            </div>

            <h4>Scenario-based UX flows</h4>
            <p>
              Once we had the building blocks, we shifted to scenario-based flows: creating a private offer, revising
              terms mid-contract, bundling multiple products, or handling renewals. These flows became alignment tools
              as much as design artifacts—they showed, step by step, how systems and users interacted in realistic
              situations, and gave teams a concrete reference when making tradeoffs.

                <strong>Defined a target quote-to-cash model for IBM SaaS subscriptions on IBM Cloud.</strong><br>
                By the end of the engagement, Skybridge had defined a clear target quote-to-cash model for IBM SaaS
                subscriptions on IBM Cloud. Instead of stitching together paygo, generic credits, and manual
                workarounds,
                teams now had a single model for how subscriptions should be ordered, entitled, provisioned, and
                tracked.

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Aligned Software business needs with Cloud platform capabilities.</strong><br>
                The unified workflows made it clear where existing Cloud systems could support Software’s subscription
                and
                compensation model, and where new capabilities were needed. Skybridge produced a shared, end-to-end
                model
                that both organizations could use—from private offer configuration, through acceptance, to provisioning
                and usage.

                <strong>Demonstrated the value of including design early in complex, systems-level work.</strong><br>
                Just as importantly, the work demonstrated how bringing design into complex, systems-level work early
                can
                change the trajectory of a project. The flows, diagrams, and scenarios we created weren’t just
                “deliverables”;
                they became reference points for architects, PMs, and leaders making strategic decisions.
