              Software private offers (code-named Skybridge) was a cross-business initiative between IBM Cloud and IBM
              Software
              to define the end-to-end quote-to-cash experience for IBM SaaS subscriptions on IBM Cloud. The work aimed
              to preserve
              software profitability, support seller compensation, and achieve parity with how IBM SaaS is sold on other
              hyperscalers,
              while creating a clear model for how subscriptions are ordered, entitled, provisioned, and tracked.
              My role focused on bringing clarity to this highly complex problem space through workflow mapping,
              cross-team alignment,
              and scenario-based UX flows that became reference artifacts for product, engineering, and leadership.

              As a Senior UX Designer, I helped shape the end-to-end experience for private offers spanning IBM Cloud
              and IBM Software. I mapped existing workflows, identified gaps and opportunities, facilitated working
              sessions, and designed system-level flows that aligned multiple teams on a single private-offer model. I
              partnered closely with PMs, architects, and engineers to codify requirements, expose dependencies, and
              create artifacts that could be used to guide both product strategy and implementation.

          <div class="case-body">
            <p>
              IBM Software’s strategy was to sell SaaS subscription entitlements for their products via IBM Cloud—not
              just as generic
              cloud spend, but as product-specific commitments that preserve margins and align with SaaS seller
              compensation. However,
              the only ordering paths available on IBM Cloud were pay-as-you-go plans, broad platform
              subscriptions/credits, or
              manual entitlements. None of these paths met the needs of the Software organization or motivated their
              sellers to sell on IBM's cloud over other hyperscalers.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the same time, IBM needed to offer a quote-to-cash experience for IBM SaaS on IBM Cloud that was at
              least on par with
              how those same products are sold on other hyperscalers. Anything less would undermine
              both the platform
              and the SaaS portfolio. The lack of a dedicated SaaS subscription model on IBM Cloud also made it
              difficult to ensure
              product-level revenue attribution, customer commitment burndown, and seller compensation.
            </p>

            <p>Key challenges included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>No dedicated SaaS subscription model on IBM Cloud that matched Software’s business needs</li>
              <li>Existing paths (paygo, generic cloud subscriptions, manual entitlements) could not preserve margins or
                support SaaS seller compensation</li>
              <li>Lack of parity with IBM SaaS ordering flows on other hyperscalers</li>
              <li>No single, unified model for how SaaS subscriptions should burn down against IBM Cloud account
                commitments</li>
              <li>Heavy reliance on manual processes that did not scale and made cancellations, renewals, and
                corrections difficult</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Business context and goals</h4>
            <p>
              From a business perspective, Skybridge needed to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Preserve software profitability by supporting discrete SaaS commitments instead of relying solely on
                paygo models</li>
              <li>Incentivize larger customer commits through subscription and overage structures aligned with Software
                pricing</li>
              <li>Ensure product-level revenue attribution for SaaS subscriptions, not just generic platform spend</li>
              <li>Achieve parity with how IBM SaaS can be ordered on other hyperscalers</li>
              <li>Align the ordering model with SaaS seller compensation so that catalog orders would not harm seller
                incentives</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              With so many systems and organizations involved (Cloud, Software, sellers, partners, billing, usage,
              entitlement) every UX decision had ripple effects across teams. Ensuring alignment required a level of
              collaboration that was difficult to achieve under normal circumstances.

            <li>
              <strong>Regular working sessions</strong><br>
              One of the biggest wins of the project was securing daily standing calls with busy senior stakeholders.
              These were highly productive sessions where we clarified requirements, surfaced hidden
              dependencies, and made rapid decisions that kept the work on track.
            </li>


            <li>
              <strong>Parity with other hyperscalers</strong><br>
              Sellers shared a surprising insight that selling IBM Software was often easier on other clouds than on
              IBM’s
              own. We conducted a comparative analysis of the private offer flows from leading hyperscalers and used
              those
              insights to set the baseline for our experience.
            </li>

                  Regular co-creation sessions with architects and PMs helped us deepen our understanding of how
                  pricing,

              <strong>Understanding technical limitations</strong><br>
              This project depended on accurately understanding how information moved through the system. Identifying
              what data the APIs exposed at each stage from quote to offer to subscription to pricing plan was essential
              for determining what the UI could display and how the experience should be structured.

                <strong>Defined a target quote-to-cash model for IBM SaaS subscriptions on IBM Cloud.</strong><br>
                The Skybridge flows established how SaaS subscriptions should be ordered, entitled, provisioned, and

                The unified workflows made it clear where existing Cloud systems could support Software’s subscription
                and compensation model. Skybridge produced a shared, end-to-end model that both organizations could use from private offer
                configuration to provisioning.

                Skybridge demonstrated how UX can add value well before UI is defined—by clarifying problem spaces,
                mapping systems, and creating artifacts that enable better strategic decisions.
