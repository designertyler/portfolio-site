              Tree View was one of the first new components added to the Carbon Design System’s core library.
              It emerged from a real customer need: teams across IBM were asking users to navigate large hierarchies of
              data, but Carbon had no native way to support that pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
              I led the UX work to define the component, from initial discovery and requirements gathering through
              interaction design, visual design, accessibility alignment, documentation, and design kit support. The
              result was a
              standards-based, community-driven component that gave product teams a reliable way to build accessible
              data trees while reducing duplicated effort and ad-hoc implementations.

              As the primary designer for Tree View, I defined the UX, interaction model, and visual design for one of
              Carbon’s first major new components. I worked closely with engineering to translate WAI-ARIA standards
              into practical behaviors and partnered with the Accessibility Guild to ensure AA compliance. I documented
              requirements openly with the community, collaborated across teams, and delivered the final specifications
              and experimental Sketch library used for early validation.

              This work began not with a roadmap, but with a placeholder GitHub issue I opened during a client
              workshop. The client relied heavily on hierarchical navigation and lacked a Carbon component that could
              support their product.
            </p>
            <p>The issue gained interest internally and externally. When people started sharing their solutions, we
              realized that our users were filling a gap in our library by hacking together similar components or
              creating it from scratch.
            </p>

            <p>
              It became obvious that teams were solving the same problem in different ways. There was no shared
              standard, no common behavior model, and no guarantee that any of these implementations met accessibility
              expectations. It was a clear signal that Carbon needed to step in with a well-defined, reusable solution.

              I began by auditing existing examples across IBM products and in-flight designs. Some teams used hacked
              accordions, some built their own trees from scratch, and others were still trying to decide how to model
              their data with Carbon's existing components. Alongside that audit, I studied W3C guidance on Tree View
              and related patterns.

            <p>
              To make sense of the feedback, I documented user needs in two layers. First, the needs of the
              end user interacting with the tree and then the team implementing the tree View.

              Accessibility was not an afterthought. The ARIA Tree pattern defines how focus should move, how
              expand and collapse work, how type-ahead behaves, and how screen readers should interpret the structure.
              I worked closely with our engineering partner to translate these rules into specific interaction
              details for Carbon.

              Documenting these details helped ensure that every implementation behaved consistently and that teams
